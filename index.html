            <p>Gibson is an absolute lovebug. He is just the sweetest dog. He's an incredible adventure partner who loves hiking, camping, and exploring the outdoors while also being the ultimate snuggle buddy during down time. He adores curling up near his people, or snoozing near them during the day. </p>
            <p>As part husky, Gibson has the playful energy and adventurous spirit you’d expect — he thrives on daily walks, outdoor time, and staying active with his people. But true to his sweet nature, once he’s had the chance to get his energy out, he’s content to settle right in and be your lap buddy. He’s great with kids and with dogs his size or larger, and while he’s never been an only dog, he would do well as the sole pup as long as he has plenty of love and attention from his human pack.</p>
            <p>Gibson has plenty of experience traveling and is a dream in the car - he settles right down and goes to sleep. </p>

            <p>Gibson was adopted from a local animal shelter in March of 2025. He came from an accidental (?) litter of puppies and lived in a home with multiple other dogs and 4 kids. He never received any vet care or training prior to his adoption and came into fa foster-to-adopt home with no house manners.</p>
            <p>Gibson is now neutered and fully vaccinated. He has learned the fundamentals of sit, down, and place (all with implied stay commands), along with a recall (come) and loose leash walking with Blackhawk K9. While Gibson is still polishing his manners, he has come a long way and thrives with consistency. He loves to please and learns quickly, and with continued training and support offfered by Blackhawk K9, he will mature into the perfect companion.</p>
            <p>Because Gibson is so athletic, he has shown he can clear a 6-foot fence, so a secure setup is important. He’ll thrive with adopters who can offer him a fenced yard with a safe space to play.</p>
